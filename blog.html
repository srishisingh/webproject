In the first phase I have learned about the basic tag, its use and so on. The progress 
on this phase is normally I have started to learn about basic tag of HTML and this page 
tag I have used in my website. 
This is the Second phase. In this phase I have learned about the basic of CSS style. CSS 
style is mainly used for styling of the website. As I have used different css style to style 
my website. In this phase I have learned to add different css styling properties and I have used

phase. So, my progress on the website is really good because I have learned much more html tag and css 
properties. I have made my website using HTML and CSS that I have learned during my web development
